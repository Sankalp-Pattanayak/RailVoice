# RailVoice

## Overview

1. Import the necessary Python packages.
2. Prepare the railway database (a sample `train.db` file is provided).
3. On first execution, create a user profile for database administration (this step is unnecessary if using the provided `train.db`).

## Prerequisites

1. Basic programming experience in Python.
2. Fundamental understanding of database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
3. Basic knowledge of Tkinter UI functions.

## Execution Steps

1. Run the `FRONT.py` module using any IDE.
2. Access the Administration tab to open the database monitoring window, where you can modify record entries.
3. Use the "Give command in Speech" tab to activate the speech recognition module. Speak your enquiry about any train listed in the database.
4. Ensure your speech includes keywords such as "from", "to", `<source_name>`, `<destination_name>`, and `<date>`.
